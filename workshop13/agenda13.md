### Workshop 13: Working on a Project Using SCRUM

**Objective**: By the end of this workshop, students will understand how to work on a project using the SCRUM framework, including roles, sprint planning, task estimation, code reviews, and retrospectives. One student will act as both the Product Owner (PO) and the Developer.

---

### **Step-by-Step Plan for SCRUM-Based Project Development**

---

### **1. Generate the Idea (Product Owner)**

- The designated student acting as the **Product Owner** (PO) should start by brainstorming and identifying a project idea. This project will serve as the basis for the SCRUM workflow.
- The idea can be a web application, CLI tool, or any software that is achievable within a few sprints.

---

### **2. Create the Product Backlog**

- The **Product Owner** breaks down the overall idea into **Epics** (large pieces of functionality or features).
- Each epic should be clearly defined and align with the goal of the project. 
- **Example Epics**:
  - User Authentication System
  - Data Persistence
  - Frontend Interface
  - API Integration

---

### **3. Refining Epics into User Stories and Tasks (Team Collaboration)**

- The **Development Team** takes each epic and breaks it down into **User Stories** (specific features or functionalities). 
- Each user story is then further divided into smaller, actionable **Tasks**. 
- **Example**:
  - **Epic**: User Authentication System
    - **User Story**: "As a user, I want to sign up with my email and password."
    - **Task 1**: Implement the signup form.
    - **Task 2**: Write backend code for authentication.
    - **Task 3**: Validate the signup process with tests.

---

### **4. Estimating Tasks and Sprint Planning**

- The team will estimate each task using **Story Points** or **Time Estimates**.
  - Use techniques like **Planning Poker** or **T-shirt Sizing** for estimates.
  - Small tasks might be 1 or 2 story points, while larger tasks could be 5 or more.
- Create a **Sprint Plan** where tasks for the first sprint are selected based on the team's capacity. 
  - The sprint typically lasts 1-2 weeks.
  - Each sprint should focus on completing a set of tasks from one or more user stories.

---

### **5. Working on Tasks**

- Each team member selects tasks from the sprint backlog and begins working on them.
- Use **Git** for version control. Each developer will:
  - Create a feature branch for the task they are working on.
  - Make regular commits to the branch as they work on the task.

---

### **6. Code Review Process**

- When a team member finishes a task, they will:
  - Push their changes to a remote branch in GitHub.
  - Open a **Pull Request (PR)** for their changes.
- Another team member will perform a **Code Review**:
  - Provide feedback, suggest improvements, or approve the code.
  - If approved, the code can be merged into the **main branch**.

---

### **7. Continuous Testing and Bug Identification**

- After each merge into the main branch:
  - The team will run tests on the application to ensure nothing is broken.
  - Identify any bugs and log them into the backlog as new user stories or tasks.
  - Prioritize bugs in the next sprint if necessary.

---

### **8. Sprint Review and Demo**

- At the end of each sprint:
  - Conduct a **Sprint Review** where the team presents completed work.
  - Demo the current version of the application to ensure that all completed tasks are functioning as expected.
  - The **Product Owner** accepts or rejects the work based on the defined acceptance criteria for each user story.

---

### **9. Retrospective Meeting**

- Hold a **Sprint Retrospective** after the sprint review:
  - Discuss what went well, what didnâ€™t, and what could be improved.
  - Identify action items for improvement in the next sprint, such as communication strategies, development workflows, or testing improvements.

---

### **10. Sprint Planning for the Next Sprint**

- Based on the feedback from the retrospective and sprint review:
  - The team updates the product backlog with any new tasks, including bug fixes.
  - Plan the next sprint by selecting a set of prioritized tasks and user stories for the next iteration.
  
---

### **11. Project Completion and Celebration**

- Once all epics and user stories are completed, the team conducts a final **Sprint Review** to ensure the product is fully functional.
- Celebrate the project's successful completion with a **team cake**!

---

### **Summary of Steps**

1. **Generate Idea** (Product Owner)
2. **Create Epics and Backlog** (Product Owner)
3. **Refine Epics into User Stories and Tasks** (Team Collaboration)
4. **Estimate and Plan the Sprint** (Team)
5. **Work on Tasks** (Developers)
6. **Perform Code Reviews** (Team)
7. **Test and Identify Bugs** (Team)
8. **Sprint Review** (Team)
9. **Retrospective** (Team)
10. **Sprint Planning** (Team)
11. **Celebrate Completion** (Team Cake!)
